State variable in react?
    : State is a global object which is used to change
      UI of your web components.
      It is used since props is read only
      so values can't be change dynamicaly using props.

JSX Prevents Injection Attacks
It is safe to embed user input in JSX:

const title = response.potentiallyMaliciousInput;
// This is safe:
const element = <h1>{title}</h1>;

  By default, React DOM escapes any values embedded in JSX
  before rendering them. Thus it ensures that you can never inject
  anything thatâ€™s not explicitly written in your application.
  Everything is converted to a string before being rendered.
  This helps prevent XSS (cross-site-scripting) attacks.
